The opacity-level describes the transparency-level, where 1 is not transparent at all, 0.5 is 50% see-through, and 0 is completely transparent.
Note: When using the opacity property to add transparency to the background of an element, all of its child elements become transparent as well.

#opacity {
    background-color: brown;
    height: 20em;
    width: 20em;
    opacity: 1;
}

//............ Opacity determines how to match with background color.....................
